      <h2>Abstract </h2>
      <p>Extracting high-quality and robust geometric
      informations plays an important role many computer vision
      applications. For instance, the noise, scale or curvature
      estimations can influence the resulting quality of shape
      recognition, matching or indexation. In this context, the aim of
      this tutorial is to present the new robust geometric estimators
      (like normals, tangents, curvature and local noise estimators),
      recently proposed in the digital geometry community, starting
      from their theoretical description up to their concrete
      implementation in the
      emerging <a href="http://dgtal.org">DGtal</a> Library framework,
      and to show some of their applications.  Such tutorial will
      benefit to the audience by showing them how to create image
      analysis tools using these features and how to integrate them in
      another framework like OpenCV.  Also, the audience will exploit
      the described advanced estimators and discover progressively the
      <i>DGtal</i> Library through several concrete tutorial
      applications, starting from simple topology based contour
      extraction to unsupervised noise detection techniques. The last
      part of this tutorial will focus on how to build online
      demonstration tools. This is especially important in image
      filtering and analysis, in order to make unbiased and
      reproducible research. This tutorial will present the new
      automated demonstration framework of
      the <a href="http://www.ipol.im">IPOL journal</a> (Image
      Processing On-Line).</p>

<p>Bertrand Kerautret received a Ph.D degree in Computer Science from
Bordeaux I University (France) in 2004. He is currently Assistant
Professor in Computer Science at Lorraine University (IUT of Saint Di√©
des Vosges, France) and works in the LORIA laboratory. His research
interests are related to computer vision problems, such as 3D shape
reconstruction, image analysis and discrete geometry. He also works on
discrete geometric estimators adapted to noisy discrete objects. He is
interested too in their applications in computer vision, and also in
archaeological, medical and agronomic imaging research. He has written
about forty papers in international journals or conferences on these
topics. He is one of the main contributors of
the <a href="http://dgtal.org">DGtal</a> Library and the manager of
<a href="https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtalTools"> DGtalTools</a>,
the part of <i>DGtal</i> dedicated to applications. He is also an active
member of the <a href="http://www.ipol.im">IPOL</a>  Editorial Board.</p>
