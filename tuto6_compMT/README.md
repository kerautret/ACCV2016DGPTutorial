## Tutorial Exercise 6: Computing the Meaningful Thickness

The main objective is to compute the Meaningful Thickness for a given point and then for all the contour points.


  - [ ] **question 1** : starting from previous exercice, iterate on 5 levels of thickness t and store in a file the ratio between t and segment length (in file resultTuto5CompATSTC_lenghts.dat)
  
  - [ ] **question 2** : construct a `Profile` object (`DGtal/math/Profile.h`) and insert the previous ratio of question 1.
  
  - [ ] **question 3** : from the previous profile construct a MeaningfulScaleAnalysis and output the scale levels of point 340 and then 200.
  
  
  
  
  You should obtain such a visualization (point index 340):
